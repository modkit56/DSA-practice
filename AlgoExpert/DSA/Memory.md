* When you write and run code, you use variables; this uses space in the memory
* Computer stores variable in back to back memory block if required
* 1 byte = 8 bits
* Endianness - [Byte Order (Endianness) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CounrFEsOeA)
* Most modern computers use "Little Endian System"
* Pointer = a memory address where memory address of a different block in memory is stored
* Computers can access the information in the memory slots very fast. i.e. in O(1) time complexity
