* A lot more on this in "CS240 Course Notes"
* Check GoodNotes!
* Only Big-o notation is needed for coding interviews
* Big-o represents the worst case performance of an algorithm
* If an algorithm consists of multiple algorithms as it's body, the worst case for the overall algorithm is worse case of it's member algorithms
* We can drop the constants in the asymptotic notation i.e. O(2n + 1) is same as O(n)

	* One linear scan: O(n)
	* Doubly Nested Loop: O(n^2)
	* Sum of two arrays of size n and m: O(n+m)

* [[O(log(n))]]
